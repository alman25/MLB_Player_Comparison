### About this project
This SQL portfolio project showcases a comprehensive analysis of Major League Baseball (MLB) player data from the Sean Lahman Baseball Database, covering the period from 1971 to 2014. The project was developed in MySQL Workbench, leveraging structured queries and advanced SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights from complex relational data.

### The database includes four key tables:

- players – demographic and career information of MLB athletes
- salaries – yearly salary details by player and team
- schools – player-school affiliations
- school details – information on educational institutions

The project is organized into four core analytical sections, each addressing specific business and analytical questions commonly relevant to sports analytics, talent scouting, and historical performance evaluations:

### Part I: School Analysis

- Identified the number of schools that produced MLB players by decade
- Ranked top schools by player output overall and per decade
- Merged institutional data to enhance insight quality

### Part II: Salary Analysis

- Calculated and ranked team spending across all years
- Tracked cumulative salary investments and identified milestone years when teams exceeded $1 billion in total compensation
- Applied percentile filtering for comparative team budget assessments

### Part III: Player Career Analysis

- Assessed player ages at debut and retirement, and computed career lengths
- Tracked starting and ending teams per player
- Highlighted players with decade-long careers who remained loyal to a single franchise

### Part IV: Player Comparison Analysis

- Matched players with shared birthdays
- Analyzed batting hand distribution per team
- Explored historical trends in debut age, height, and weight, with decade-over-decade comparisons

This project emphasizes SQL best practices, including data joining, aggregation, filtering, window functions, and subqueries. It demonstrates the ability to extract actionable insights, design data-driven queries, and support data storytelling using raw relational data.
